Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to view the webpage.

git clone <repository-url>

Open the index.html file in any web browser.

File Details

1. HTML (index.html)

Contains the structure of the webpage, including navigation, sections, and footer.

Includes placeholders for images and video files.

2. CSS (styles.css)

Manages the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design.

Ensures responsiveness using media queries.

3. JavaScript (script.js)

Provides functionality for interactive elements like the carousel.

Includes event listeners for user interaction.

4. Assets

Images and video files used in the project are stored in the assets/ folder.

Customization

Update the images and videos in the assets/ folder to replace placeholders with your own content.

Modify the text content in the index.html file to reflect your brand's messaging.

Change colors, fonts, and styles in styles.css to match your desired theme.

Known Issues

Local File Paths: Ensure all image and video paths are correct. Absolute file paths (e.g., C:\Users\...) should be replaced with relative paths (e.g., assets/images/image1.png) to ensure compatibility.

Carousel Functionality: Make sure the JavaScript logic in script.js is properly connected and functioning.

Future Enhancements

Add functionality to product buttons (e.g., "Explore More").

Implement dynamic data loading using JavaScript or a backend service.

Add animations for smoother transitions.
